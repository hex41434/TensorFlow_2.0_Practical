**Build Your First Simple Perceptron (Single Neural Layer Model)
Project 1: Convert Celsius to Fahrenheit**


In this project, we will build a simple machine learning model to convert temperatures from Celsius to Fahrenheit. 
The equation is as follows:
T(degrees Fahrenheit) = T(degrees Celsius) * 9/5 + 32 

We are building a simple neural network that takes an input temperature in Celsius and gives us an output temperature in Fahrenheit. 

The objective is to predict the value of one variable Y based on another variable X. X is called the independent variable, and Y is called the dependent variable. Mapping one value to another like this is called ***"regression."***
"Regression is a statistical measurement that attempts to determine the strength of the relationship between one dependent variable (usually denoted by Y) and a series of other changing variables (known as independent variables.) Regression takes a group of random variables, thought to be predicting Y, and tries to find a mathematical relationship between them. This relationship is typically in the form of a straight line (linear regression) that approximates all the individual data points." https://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/regression.asp
