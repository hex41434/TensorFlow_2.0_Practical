One of the most common problems while training deep neural networks is overfitting. “Overfitting occurs when a statistical model or machine learning algorithm captures the noise of the data. Intuitively, overfitting occurs when the model or the algorithm fits the data too well. Specifically, overfitting occurs if the model or algorithm shows low bias but high variance. Overfitting is often a result of an excessively complicated model, and it can be prevented by fitting multiple models and using validation or cross-validation to compare their predictive accuracies on test data.” https://chemicalstatistician.wordpress.com/2014/03/19/machine-learning-lesson-of-the-day-overfitting-and-underfitting/
