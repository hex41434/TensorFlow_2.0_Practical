What is ***Google Colab***? Colaboratory is a research tool for machine learning education and research. It’s a free Jupyter Notebook environment that runs in the Cloud. 
* Collaboratory allows you to use and share Jupyer notebooks with others without having to download, install, or run anything on your computer other than a browser. Google Colab gives us free access to CPUs, GPUs, and even TPUs. TPUs are a dedicated chip that can be used to run machine learning models. Wikipedia says, “A tensor processing unit (TPU) is an AI accelerator application-specific integrated circuit (ASIC) developed by Google specifically for neural network machine learning.” https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tensor_processing_unit
 It is pretty incredible to have access to this hardware for free like this.
