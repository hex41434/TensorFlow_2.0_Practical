Three subsets of machine learning are:
* ***Supervised learning***: training algorithms using labeled input/output data. 
  + Classification and regression tasks.
  + For classification tasks, there is a discrete output. You choose one of many classes.
  + For regression tasks, you predict continuous values. For example, stock price tomorrow.
  + Performance is assessed by comparing trained model prediction to real output. 
  + It is expensive and tedious to label data. 

* ***Unsupervised learning***: training algorithms with no labeled data. It attempts to discover hidden patterns on its own. Have a bunch of inputs with no target output. 
  + Clustering tasks. 
  + Unsupervised learning methods can analyze complex data that humans might find difficult to interpret. 
  + Unlike supervised learning, we don’t have feedback like labels to assess whether the model’s performance matched expected results. 

* ***Reinforcement learning***: algorithm takes actions to maximize cumulative reward 
  + Reinforcement algorithms learn by trial and error through reward and penalty. 
  + You have two elements: the environment and the learning agent.
  + The environment rewards the agent for correct actions.
  + Based on the reward or penalty, the agent improves its environment knowledge to make better decisions.
