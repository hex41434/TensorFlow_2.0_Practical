Notes from the Course Introduction:
* ***Artificial Intelligence*** is the science the empowers computers to mimic human intelligence, such as decision making, text processing, and visual perception. AI is the broader field that contains several subfields such as machine learning, robotics, and computer vision. 

* ***Machine Learning*** is a subfield of Artificial Intelligence that enables machines to improve at a given task with experience. It is important to note that all machine learning techniques are AI techniques. Not all AI techniques are Machine Learning techniques. Some rule-based engines are AI, but they don’t learn from experience and aren’t in the machine learning category. 

* ***Deep Learning*** is a specialized field of Machine Learning that relies on training Deep Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) using large datasets such as images. ANNs are information-processing models loosely inspired by how neurons in the human brain communicate with each other using electrical and chemical signals. 

* The difference between machine learning and deep learning is that deep learning techniques involve extracting features automatically. A machine learning process consists of selecting the model to train and then manually performing feature extraction. The deep learning process consists of choosing the architecture of the network. Then features are automatically extracted by feeding in the training data (such as images) along with the target class (label).
